# Pass-save
This application is used to save all of your passwords. It is stored locally. It can create random passwords for you.

IT IS NOT ENCRYPTED!

It is a fully interactive GUI application written in python. The data is stored as a python dictionary. 

Initially you have to create a login password for the application. It prevents the user from opening the application. 
There are:
3 fields: Website, Username, Password. Website can be any site or application where you have a Username and a Password.
3 Features: Add - Add an entry to list, Random - Create random password, Delete - Deletes an entry.

-  To delete an entry, you must provide all 3 fields, website, username and password.
-  It only deletes if all 3 fields match.
-  The length of Random Password and the Login Password can be changed in the Edit menu.
-  Also all the data can be deleted as well from Edit Menu.
-  You cannot add an entry if the website name already exists.
-  The data will be saved in data.svb file once the application is run for the first time.

I've added all features I could think of. Feel free to edit it or use it in your next project.
